# Calculator
Simple calculator made with Java with GUI and BigDecimal for precision.

Main is in the Calculator.java.

I'm learning Java and GUI-programming for the first time.
That's why I started with awt (yuck).

I am a newbie when it comes to the OOP.
This project was for me to learn the concept better.
I also wanted to learn GUI-programming.
I got some more experience at working with classes and objects.
I am now much more familiar with the Observer desing pattern.

Decision to use BigDecimals was obvious. I thought of using double,
since this was initially supposed to be a project to understand OOP
and awt better. Actually I even made the first version using double
instead of BigDecimal, but I was hugely dissappointed with the precision
of double, even if this was only for practice.

There is an interesting bug that rounds decimals always down, if there
are too many decimals to display. I didn't think it was worth it to
fix that bug, even though it wouldn't be that hard to fix.

To sum up: This was a casual project to learn the basics of GUI-programming.
Please, view it as such. That's why there are some odd decicions.
